> Based on what I have observed in our class, there are still things that we can improve:
- Pronunciation - Please practice the correct pronunciation of words that contains letters `v` and `z`. In addition,

- Speaking skills: excessive use of the expression `yeah`. Encouraging you to express your ideas instead of ending each
  id with the stated expression.

  fast with some mispronounced words. w
